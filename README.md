# CFG Project
 
 

Welcome!
This is my first big project which I have completed in a team with two team members as part of my career switcher course with CFG Python and Web Apps Course. Over the course of the eight-week period, I learned the fundamental of python and reinforced my learning at the end of the course by building a small Food Program that works both with python and Edamam API.
This program was created to help users find lists of tasty food recipes, based on their preferred ingredient type and optional dietary requirements. At the end of the program, the user’s results will be automatically saved to a text file.


Here I have provided code snippets of what to expect when using the program:
